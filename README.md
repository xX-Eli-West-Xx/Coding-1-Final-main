------------    My Final Project    ---------------

I decided to do a pet groming company for this. It seemed like something easy enough, and I really enjoy doing things with animals.
I have a good amount of info on the about page that I think would draw in customers.
I made the company revolve around them being in trucks, and busses to keep them mobile and visit new places with their services. Because of that, I was able to bypass needing a location. I was able to just say in the US of A. I really enjoyed this project. It was fun to see what I could do in such a small amount of time. It really shows me my limits, I guess...

Thanks for the great time coach. :)

PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS NOT A REAL COMPANY!!!
